# BWM-PROMETHEE-ASSIGNMENT.jl

This repo presents a BWM-PROMETHEE II function implemented in Julia.

JuMP and GLPK were used to apply the BWM linear optimization model. 

The procedure was applied to analyze shipping companies in a bidding process for different routes. The generated net flows were then used as input for an General Assignment model.

An example can be executed in the file: main.jl while the functions are available in src/Methods.jl
